# js13kgames-2019
Submission for the Js13kGames competition 2019

Working title: The Martians are Back!

I always wanted to write a bubble shooter in the 99-balls-style, so I think I'll do that, though I still only have vague ideas how to fit the theme in.

Current version is playable on https://schnark.github.io/js13kgames-2019/game.html

Please note:
* "Persistent" data currently persist only for the current session (to allow me debugging things only shown at start etc.), so don't try to reach great highscores yet.
* Until now the game is only tested in desktop Firefox, but it probably works both on desktop and mobile on any browser.
