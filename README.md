# The Martians are Back!
Submission for the Js13kGames competition 2019

I always wanted to write a bubble shooter in the 99-balls-style, so I did that, and made it fit with the theme "back" afterwards.

There are several versions of the game:

* Development version is on https://schnark.github.io/js13kgames-2019/game.html
* Minified version is on https://schnark.github.io/js13kgames-2019/min/index.html
* Official version submitted for the competition isn't available yet.
* Perhaps I will create a variant of this game as hybrid FFOS app/PWA, like my other apps. This will probably live in a different repository.
