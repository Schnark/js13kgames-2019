# js13kgames-2019
Submission for the Js13kGames competition 2017

I always wanted to write a bubble shooter in the 99-balls-style, so I think I'll do that, though I still only have vague ideas how to fit the theme in.

Current version is playable on https://schnark.github.io/js13kgames-2019/game.html

Please note:
* "Persistent" data currently persist only for the current session (to allow me debugging things only shown at start etc.), so don't try to reach great highscores yet. The difficulty needs to be balanced properly, anyway, and even the current level management is likely to change (depending on the background story, and including intro and outro).
* Sound isn't ready yet.
* Most icons are just placeholders that will be changed, again depending on the background story. Also the size of the canvas (and related stuff like fullscreen) will probably change.
* Until now the game is only tested in desktop Firefox, finally it should work both on desktop and mobile on any browser.
